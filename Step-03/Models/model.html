    <h2>Why Box Model</h2>
    <p>
      We can see that there is some spacing from the photo to the frame and
      spacing between the multiple photo frames on the wall. CSS box model can
      be related to the above example. Each photo frame can be considered as an
      HTML element. The photo present in each frame can be considered as the
      HTML content. The spacing from the photo to the frame is equivalent to
      padding. The frame itself is the border, The distance between the inner
      boundary to the outer boundary (the width of the brown portion in the
      above image shown ) is equivalent to the border width. The spacing between
      one frame to another frame or the wall is the margin
    </p>
    <h2>What is box Model</h2>
    <p>
      The CSS box model is a container, which wraps around every HTML element.
      It consists of margins, borders, padding along with the actual content.
    </p>
    <p>
      The space from the content to the border is padding. The green box around
      the element is the border and the thickness of the border is the width of
      the border. The spacing from the HTML element to the neighboring elements
      is the margin. The width and height of an element include padding, border,
      and margin
    </p>
    <h2>border Property</h2>
    <p>
      The padding, margin, and border are the CSS properties, which helps in
      providing proper spacing to the HTML element so that the webpage is
      readable by the end-users
