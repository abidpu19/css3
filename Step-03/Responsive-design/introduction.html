    <h2>What is Responsive Design</h2>
    <p>
      A Responsive page is a web page that renders well in all the devices like
      desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobiles, which have different screen sizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A responsive page will adapt to the screen size and will look good on
      every device. These pages adjust to the screen resolution or simply the
      screen size and orientation (in case of mobile and tablet) of the device
      being used to view the web page.
    </p>
    <h4>
      We can make a web page's layout change according to the screen size using
      the below techniques
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Fluid Layouts</li>
      <li>Flexible Images</li>
      <li>Media Queries</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Flexible Images</h3>
    <p>
      The image grows or shrinks according to the container dimensions. We need
      to specify the width of the image using the percentage of its container
      width.
    </p>
    <h5>Setting the width of foreground images</h5>
    <p>
      We will apply relative dimensions to the <img /> element Problem: Consider
      we have an image that needs to be displayed at 150X150 size inside a 720
      px wide element and we want it to scale it as the parent element scales.
      Solution: For the above problem, we can have a container exclusively for
      the image, set its relative size on the container, and let the image fill
      container width. i.e., 150/720 = 20.8333% and to scale the image when the
      parent scales but limit the extent to which it scales up/down we can set
      max-width/min-width on the parent.
    </p>
    <h3>Setting the width of the background images</h3>
    <p>
      Problem: Consider we want the background image to scale when the element
      for which background is set to scales. Solution: For the above problem, we
      can set background-size: 100%
    </p>
    <h2>Fluid Layouts</h2>
    <p>
      Layout grows and shrinks according to the viewport dimensions. We need to
      use relative units such as % instead of absolute units (px). In order to
      fit the layout to viewport width, we will replace absolute units for
      dimensions of elements(px) with relative units (%) The width of the
      topmost element (&lt;html&gt;) is browser width (due to viewport tag) Thus
      specifying the width of all elements using % will scale the layout to the
      viewport width. Such a layout is called fluid layout We need to represent
      all px widths as % of the corresponding parent width.
    </p>
    <h3>Media queries</h3>
    <p>
      Media queries apply CSS styling based on the device form factors. Hence
      the layout can differ on a desktop, tablet, and mobile
    </p>
    <h2>Media Types</h2>
    <p>The important media types are</p>
    <table>
      <caption>
        Media Types
      </caption>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Media Type</th>

        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>all</td>
          <td>Applies to all devices (default value)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>handheld</td>
          <td>Applies to handheld devices</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>print</td>
          <td>Applies to printer</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>screen</td>
          <td>Applies to screen</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>tv</td>
          <td>Applies to tv</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <h2>Media Features</h2>
    <table>
      <caption>
        important Media typs

      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Feature</th>
          <th>Values</th>
          <th>min/max</th>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>device-height, device-width</td>
          <td>number</td>
          <td>yes</td>
          <td>Height/Width of the output device (specified in px, em, etc.)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>height, width</td>
          <td>number/td></td>
          <td>yes</td>
          <td>Height/Width of the viewport</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>orientation</td>
          <td>landscape | portrait</td>
          <td>no</td>
          <td>The orientation of the device</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>resolution</td>
          <td>number</td>
          <td>yes</td>
          <td>Resolution(pixel density) of the device (in dpi, dpcm, etc.)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>device</td>
          <td>number</td>
          <td>yes</td>
          <td>
            The number of device pixels per CSS pixel. Used to detect
            high-resolution screens like iPad retina
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      It is observed that sometimes mobile devices display a full desktop site.
      In such cases, the computed page width is much higher than the expected
      and hence the appropriate media queries will not be applied. It also
      results in pages being zoomed out on mobile devices.
    </p>
    <h4>To overcome the above problem we can use the viewport meta tag</h4>
    <p>
      &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0,
      maximum-scale=1.0, user-scale=0"&gt;
    </p>
  </body>
