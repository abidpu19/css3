      Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3. A media query consists
      of a media type and at least one expression that limits the style sheets'
      scope by using media features, such as width, height, and color.

      <b>NOTE: </b>
      <li>
        Breakpoints have to be carefully added while working with Media queries.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is preferred to use ‘em’ while defining media queries, other than
        pixels.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make use of the min-width feature of a media query to achieve
        responsiveness.
