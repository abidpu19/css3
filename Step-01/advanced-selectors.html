    <h2>
      In CSS3 new selectors have been introduced for efficient selection of HTML
      elements.
    </h2>
    <p>These selectors have been categorized into the following.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Relational Selectors</li>
      <li>Attribute Selectors</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Consider a scenario where we want to style only the direct child element
      of a parent ignoring the nested child elements or if we have a requirement
      where we want to style the sibling of an element. In these scenarios, we
      can use relational selectors. Let us explore relational selector
    </p>
    <table border="1" style="margin: 10px; background-color: azure">
      <caption style="font-size: large; font-weight: 800">
        Relational Selectors
      </caption>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Selector</th>
          <th>Description</th>
          <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Child A>B</td>
          <td>
            Selects any element B that is a direct child of A(ignores the deeper
            nested elements)
          </td>
          <td>section > p</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Adjacent Sibling A+B</td>
          <td>
            Selects the B element that is placed immediately after the A element
            and shares the same parent. This selects only the immediate sibling.
          </td>
          <td>h1 + p</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>General Sibling A ~ B</td>
          <td>
            Selects all the B elements that are placed after the A element and
            share the same parent. This selects all the siblings.
          </td>
          <td>div ~ p</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <h2>Attribute Selectors</h2>
    <p>
      If we have a requirement to style an element based on the attribute of the
      element or based on the value of the attribute of the element
    </p>

    <table border="1">
      <caption style="font-size: large; font-weight: 800">
        Attribute Selector
      </caption>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Attribute Selector</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>a [attribute]</td>
          <td>Selects all A elements with the specified attribute.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>a[attribute=value]</td>
          <td>Selects all A elements with specified attribute and value.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>a[attribute^=value]</td>
          <td>
            Selects all A elements where the value of attribute starts with the
            specified value
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>a[attribute$=value]</td>
          <td>
            Selects all A elements where the value of attribute ends with the
            specified value.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>a[attribute*=value]</td>
          <td>
            Selects all A elements where the value of the attribute contains the
            specified value.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Best Practice</h2>
    <p>
      If multiple selectors are used inside CSS, keep it in a separate line. p,
      h4, h5{ text-align: left /* Appropriate way to apply CSS for multiple
      selectors */ }
    </p>
    <p>
      Including descendant selectors in the CSS style sheet is a good practice
      to improve efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Avoid usage of ID selectors as much as possible, since they are of higher
      specificity, it is difficult to override them at a later point
