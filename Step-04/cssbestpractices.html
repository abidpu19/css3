    <h1>CSS Best Practices:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Large style sheets can be broken into small ones for modularity and easy
        understanding.
      </li>
      <li>
        The CSS code should be in a readable format so that readers can easily
        understand.
      </li>
      <li>
        Properties can be Alphabetized; all the properties can be arranged in
        alphabetical order for better readability.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Static element can be given a negative margin and when it is given a
        negative margin on the top/left, it will pull the element in that
        specified direction. For example : #mydiv1 {margin-top:-20px;} moves the
        element 20px upwards.
      </li>
      <li>
        CSS code and HTML code should be validated before executing the program.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use External CSS sheet for reusability purpose, Inline styling should be
        avoided as much as po
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove comments and whitespaces in the code before executing, as the
        whitespaces and comments would increase the file size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add proper comments to CSS blocks which will help others to understand
        your code, and it will also be easy to analyze the code later on.
      </li>
      <li>Logically divide the web content of the webpage and apply styles.</li>
      <li>
        Create common styles in your style sheet and we can following this order
        of sequence:
        <ul>
          <li>header</li>
          <li>footer</li>
          <li>body</li>
          <li>p, div</li>
          <li>h1,h2,h3</li>
          <li>hyperlinks</li>
          <li>nav</li>
          <li>ordered lists and unordered lists</li>
          <li>table</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Instead of using one large style sheet for an application, it is advised
        to logically split the style sheets into multiple smaller ones for an
        application.
      </li>
      <li>Add a space after each comma, except within color functions.</li>
      <li>
        Its preferred to ignore units on 0 values. For example use “margin-left:
        0” instead of “margin-left:0px”
      </li>
      <li>
        It is best practice to use the expanded syntax instead of shorthand. For
        example use “background-color:’red’” instead of background:’red’
      </li>
      <li>
        To follow consistency, the class names should be in lowercase with the
        words separated by _. For example “class_one” is a valid CSS class name.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is preferred to use inline-start or inline-end property rather than
        left/ right property with margins, padding, and borders. For example use
        margin-inline-start: 2px instead of margin-let:3px.
      </li>
    </ul>
