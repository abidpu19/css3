    <h2>Why CSS Security</h2>
    <p>
      Let us now understand why we need to take care of vulnerabilities in CSS.
      There is a possibility of injecting malicious code through CSS. If
      stylesheets in a web application are weak, then an attacker can add some
      styles which can do modification on the appearance of the web page.
      Therefore there is a need to find the attacks possible in CSS and their
      preventive measures to defend against those attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a web developer, we need to take care of writing preventive measures
      for all possible vulnerabilities in web pages. As we use CSS for styling
      those web pages, we should be aware of all possible vulnerabilities in
      this language. Let us now see what are the security risks possible in CSS
    </p>
    <h3>CSS Security</h3>
    <p>
      Cascading StyleSheet is used to style the web pages. Mostly CSS files will
      be treated as the least priority in terms of security. But there are risks
      involved with these files as well. Many web developers will use a global
      stylesheet file to store all styles related to a web application. This
      approach involves few risks associated with it. An attacker can view all
      the styles using the view source option in the browser and can understand
      the features of the application by seeing the CSS class names. For
      example, if a developer has created class names as ".addUser",
      ".addAdmin", etc., an attacker will get some information that styles are
      being applied based on roles. This information can be favorable to the
      attacker. Another risk possible is an attacker can even inject some
      malicious styles into the page which can lead to some undesired operations
      like changing the appearance of a web app, understanding the sensitive
      information of the application which can lead to data theft, etc.,

      Following is the CSS vulnerability we are going to discuss further:

      vulnerability and its mitigation with examples.
